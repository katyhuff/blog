# Katy Huff's Blog

This blog is the newest of many. 
All the action happens in the gh-pages branch. 

It's all based on something I forked called Left.  It uses jekyll.  It was 
extracted from [zachholman.com](http://zachholman.com/), which means it was 
battle-hardened from years of posting serious blog posts about emoji and swear 
words.
