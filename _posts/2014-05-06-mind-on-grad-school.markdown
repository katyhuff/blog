The Berkeley Science Review just published an [excellent 
article](http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/article/mind-grad-school/ "This is 
Your Mind on Grad School") on graduate student mental health at Berkeley. It is 
entitled "This is Your Mind on Grad School." If you have any connection to 
higher education, academic culture, public health, mental heath or another human 
who is pre-, mid-, or post- grad school : **read it**. Full disclosure, the 
authors of this excellent piece are friends of mine. Denia, in particular, is 
one of my most favorite people in the whole wide world. 

# Close to Home

In grad school, I had an excellent advisor and was part of many supportive 
communities. For this reason, my experience was relatively quite positive. 
However, even the best graduate experiences are punctuated by some difficulty. 
The first sentence of [Denia and Sebastian's 
artcle](http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/article/mind-grad-school/ "This is 
Your Mind on Grad School") punched me right in the gut: 

> ''Graduate school is the first time that you really fail, and really feel like a 
> failure in the one thing that you are really completely invested in.'' 

The rest of the first paragraph just kept punching. The sentiments of total 
strangers echoed perfectly the graduate  experiences of uncountably many of my 
colleagues and close friends. It went like this: 

> ''When I think about my  years as a graduate student at Berkeley, I think of 
> days filled with a vague, ever-present cloud of guilt and anxiety,'' describes 
> another former student.  ''Most days in lab were spent surrounded by brilliant 
> people striving for something great rather than by supportive people looking 
> to facilitate each other’s growth.'' A current graduate student echoes that 
> ''there is a deep, pervasive anxiety that seeps into every day of your life, a 
> constant questioning of your capability, intelligence, and whether or not you 
> are cut out to be here.'' Another former student says, ''It took me many years 
> to realize that ‘normal’ for many grad students means deeply—and 
> secretly—depressed.''

# What to Do

The article gets more effective in the paragraphs that follow, of course, when 
it introduces some really interesting data, an analysis of likely causes, an 
assessment of relevant efforts on campus, and resources of note. 

I won't spoil it for you. Go forth and [check it 
out](http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/article/mind-grad-school/ "Your Mind on 
Grad School") . The interviews and the data are fascinating, the writing is 
great, and the problem is real.
