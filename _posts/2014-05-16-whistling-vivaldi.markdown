Professor Claude M. Steele writes emails to me sometimes. That is, as an 
executive vice chancellor and provost at Berkeley, he sometimes sends a 
friendly mass email to the whole campus during finals week to remind everyone 
to please take care of one another.  I'm sometimes a lucky recipient of one of 
these and, as mass emails go, they are charming. 

In addition to these emails, it turns out, Claude Steele once wrote a book that 
my friends have all recently and simultaneously suggested that I read.  The 
book is called ["Whistling Vivaldi: How Stereotypes Affect Us and What We Can 
Do,"](http://www.amazon.com/Whistling-Vivaldi-Stereotypes-Affect-Issues/dp/0393339726 
"Whistling Vivaldi")  and I read it this week ( [1] ). What follows is my quick 
review.

# Whistling Who?

Perhaps my prevailing emotion about this book is tied to the first one I had 
while reading it. That is, the story of the eponymous whistler of Vivaldi - which I'll leave 
as a heartwrenching experience for the reader - plucked a particularly somber heartstring for 
me. It will likely do the same for anyone else who has walked the sidewalks of that 
bubble of brilliance, that community of class clashes, that origin of Obamas - 
Hyde Park, Chicago.  

# The Storytelling

Professor Steele and his colleagues are responsible for the seminal social 
psychological experiments that defined and characterized stereotype threat.  
The book mostly tells the story of those decades of experiments. 

It reads smoothly, but I often found myself critically curious about the 
details of the experiments, which were largely glossed over. That is, when I 
read "The results clearly showed that ..." I often immediately wonder "What was 
the p-value on that result?" But, the book was convincingly and compellingly 
written. So, while I would have liked more direct references and more details, 
I still learned a lot about the symptoms, mechanisms, and solutions of 
stereotype threat. 

# The Situation

In short, stereotype threat is all around us. When a young girl is flustered in a math test, stereotype threat has already polluted the air she breathes. When black college students don't succeed according to the level predicted by their SAT scores, 
stereotype threat is muting their potential in myriad ways on campus. Professor 
Steele and colleagues showed that when stereotype-threatened students took a 
test, they didn't have to experience any direct prejudice to underperfom due to 
the threat because ( [1] ):

> They were taking this test, and others like it, under the weight of history.

That's why, when a white man gets quiet in a racial profiling discussion with people of other 
races, it's because he is tonguetied by a fear that he'll be perceived as racist 
if he opens his mouth.  These were the main examples given by Professor Steele 
and they revolve around "contingencies" rather than direct prejudice. To wit 
( [1] ):

> There exists no group on earth that is not negatively stereotyped in some 
> way—the old, the young, northerners, southerners, WASPs, computer whiz kids, 
> Californians, and so forth. And when people with these identities are doing 
> something, or are in a situation for which a negative stereotype about their 
> group is relevant, they can feel stereotype threat; they can feel under 
> pressure not to confirm the stereotype for fear that they will be judged or 
> treated in terms of it. Identity threats like this—contingencies of 
> identity—are part of everyone’s life.

# The Fix

Thankfully, this research has found some solutions as well ( [1] ) :

> If you want to change the behaviors and outcomes associated with social 
> identity—say, too few women in computer science—don’t focus on changing the 
> internal manifestations of the identity, such as values, and attitudes. Focus 
> instead on changing the contingencies to which all of that internal stuff is an 
> adaptation.

There are many ways to change these contingencies, but my favorite has to do 
with how to give critical feedback when mentoring a student who is susceptible to 
stereotype threat ( [1] ) :

> The feedback giver explained that he “used high standards” in evaluating the 
> essays for publication in the teaching magazine. Still, he said, having read 
> the student’s essay, he believed the student could meet those standards. His 
> criticism, this form of feedback implies, was offered to help the student 
> meet the publication’s high standards. Black students trusted this feedback 
> as much as white students, and trusting it powerfully motivated them to 
> improve their essay.

I can see why this works. I don't want people to "go easy" on me, so the 
expression of high standards is important. But, I also don't want high 
standards to be a cover-up for bias, so the expression of confidence in my 
abilities is also important.

# Now What?

If you're an educator or student of any kind, this book provides actionable 
suggestions with which you can truly combat cultural bias. You really should  
[read it before you teach or take another 
class](http://www.amazon.com/Whistling-Vivaldi-Stereotypes-Affect-Issues/dp/0393339726 
"Whistling Vivaldi") . It was a quick read (about 4.5 hours).
