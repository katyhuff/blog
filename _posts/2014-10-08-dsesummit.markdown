This week, I participated in the Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment Summit, a 
collaborative meeting between three data science centers at UC Berkeley, 
NYU, and the University of Washington.
By virtue of being a fellow with the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, I was 
invited to participate in this meeting along with the PI's, Co-PI's, Senior 
Fellows, and other researchers who are part of BIDS, NYU's center for Data 
Science, and the University of Washington's eScience center.

# Asilomar

This first annual meeting was hosted at the Asilomar Conference Grounds near 
Monterrey, CA. 

## The Monterrey Bay Aquarium

The first thing on the agenda was the Monterrey Bay Aquarium. 
I'd always wanted to visit, and it was everything I could have imagined an 
aquarium might be.
There's an excellent jellyfish exhibit as well as a brannd new cephalopod 
exhibit. The octopuses, squids, and cuttlefish were amazing creatures. 

## The Conference Grounds

The conference grounds, designed by architect Julia Morgan, provide a beautiful 
arts and crafts style campus with a lovely nearby beach.

# Bonding and Community Building

In order to solidify the collaborative bonds between the diverse scientists at
the geographically disperse campuses involved in the collaboration, we did 
various bonding and collaboration building activities. While that's not usually 
[my jam](thatsmyjam.com), I did learn a few things. 

## Dav Clark FTW

The most important thing I learned was to have [Dav Clark](davsite.com) on your 
team If possible, maximize the experience by having a David Clark on your team 
as well. Out of five people, our team had two Dav\* Clarks and we were the 
winners. Coincidence? I think not.

## Fail Fast

The other lesson from the activity was straight out of agile workflows: fail fast. By prototyping 
quickly and racing ahead with the first reasonable-sounding idea that was 
suggested, we started actually building before a lot of other teams and had 
more time for quality control. In an analogy to the collaboration, this lesson 
suggests that rather than spending too much longer getting a plan together, we 
should just start moving with the ideas that we already have. Ideally, allowing 
ourselves room to fail fast, we'll actually get some fast successes along the 
way.

# Unconferencing

Rather than allow a planning committee to 
sdictate the meeting subject matter, the attendees collaborated on a 
conference schedule for Monday and Wednesday mornings. It resulted in a set of 
topics I had trouble choosing between (being only one person, I can only attend 
one session at a time, after all).

## Visualization Session

The frist session I attended was the vizualization session, where I leared 
about (and cheered for) a few interesting tools.

## Demos Session

I ended up (by virtue of being outspoken and often standing within earshot of Kevin Koy) leading the 

- Zhao Zhang showed off the AMPStack
- Kyle Cranmer demonstrated the collaborative statistics modeling framework 
  behind the LHC
- Dan Halperin showed off Myria
- Brian McFee showed off some sweet tools for audio analysis
- etc.
- And Saul Perlmutter framed a discussion around goals, dreams, and the needs 
  for workflow tools.

# Research Microblogging

I learned this morning, that David Hogg, who was an excellent feature of this event, 
[blogs](http://hoggresearch.blogspot.com/) five times a week about research! 
Amazing, IMO.  The rules he has instituted for himself are : 

> I must post five days per week (I choose which five), except when traveling, 
> no matter what I have done.

and 

> I must write only about research; no committees, no refereeing, no teaching, 
> no excuses.

It seems overly ambitious and questionably helpful, but I guess he's been doing 
it for years, so it must be serving him well somehow. In the same way that 
Titus' blog is an impressive body of work, so too is this blog. I'm inspired.

He also has [a teaching blog.](http://hoggteaching.blogspot.com/)
