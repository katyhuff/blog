This week, I participated in the Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment Summit, a 
collaborative meeting between three data science centers at UC Berkeley, 
NYU, and the University of Washington.
By virtue of being a fellow with the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, I was 
invited to participate in this meeting along with the PI's, Co-PI's, Senior 
Fellows, and other researchers who are part of 
[BIDS](http://bids.berkeley.edu), [NYU's center for Data 
Science](http://datascience.nyu.edu/), and the [University of Washington's 
eScience institute](http://escience.washington.edu/).

## Asilomar

This first annual meeting was hosted at the Asilomar Conference Grounds near 
Monterrey, CA. 

### The Monterrey Bay Aquarium

The first thing on the agenda was the Monterrey Bay Aquarium. 
I'd always wanted to visit, and it was everything I could have imagined an 
aquarium might be.
There's an excellent jellyfish exhibit as well as a brannd new cephalopod 
exhibit. The octopuses, squids, and cuttlefish were amazing creatures. 

### The Conference Grounds

I learned from 
Professor Henry Brady and his lovely wife that Asilomar was designed by architect 
[Julia Morgan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Morgan) in  beautiful arts 
and crafts style. The grounds are simply lovely and have a fun, if cold, nearby 
beach.

## Bonding and Community Building

In order to solidify the collaborative bonds between the diverse scientists at
the geographically disperse campuses involved in the collaboration, we did 
various bonding and collaboration building activities. While that's not usually 
[my jam](https://www.thisismyjam.com/), I did learn a few things. 

### Dav Clark FTW

The most important thing I learned was to have [Dav Clark](davsite.com) on your 
team If possible, maximize the experience by having a David Clark on your team 
as well. Out of five people, our team had two Dav\* Clarks and we were the 
winners. Coincidence? I think not.

### Fail Fast

The other lesson from the activity was straight out of agile workflows: fail fast. By prototyping 
quickly and racing ahead with the first reasonable-sounding idea that was 
suggested, we started actually building before a lot of other teams and had 
more time for quality control. In an analogy to the collaboration, this lesson 
suggests that rather than spending too much longer getting a plan together, we 
should just start moving with the ideas that we already have. Ideally, allowing 
ourselves room to fail fast, we'll actually get some fast successes along the 
way.

![Of course, it's better to succeed fast](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/move_fast_and_break_things.png "hopefully we won't break too much stuff")



## Unconferencing

Rather than allow a planning committee to 
sdictate the meeting subject matter, the attendees collaborated on a 
conference schedule for Monday and Wednesday mornings. It resulted in a set of 
topics I had trouble choosing between (being only one person, I can only attend 
one session at a time, after all).

### Visualization Session

The first session I attended was the vizualization session, where we mentioned 
and (and cheered for) a few interesting tools.

- [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) (data driven documents)
- Topic modeling in R using [LDAvis](https://github.com/cpsievert/LDAvis/), [related blog post](http://ropensci.org/blog/2014/04/16/topic-modeling-in-R/)
- [yt](http://yt-project.org/) (demo: Katy Huff) - good for zoomable views on large (hierarchical?) data sets  (including meshes, lots of astro examples of data cube data)
- [DS9 (astronomy)](http://ds9.si.edu/site/Home.html)
- [Mayavi](http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/)
- dv3d (tom maxwell, nasa, for climate)
- [RCharts.io](http://rcharts.io/)
- [IPython interactive charts using interacive widget system](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/tree/master/examples/Interactive%20Widgets) demo: Fernando
- [Max](http://cycling74.com/products/max/) (this is for artists!)
- [Vistrails](http://www.vistrails.org/index.php/Main_Page)


### Demos Session

I ended up (by virtue of being outspoken and often standing within earshot of 
Kevin Koy) leading the tools session. It was a great series of lightning talks 
(7 thrilling minutes per person!):

- Brian McFee showed off [LibROSA](https://github.com/bmcfee/librosa/), some sweet tools for audio analysis
- Dan Halperin showed off [Myria](http://myria.cs.washington.edu/), an abstracted, accessible interface for relational database exploration
- Zhao Zhang showed off the AMPStack
- [Kyle Cranmer](http://theoryandpractice.org/) demonstrated the collaborative statistics modeling framework behind the LHC (RooFit, RooPlot, Roostats)
- Mike Blanton gave a description of typical astronomer workflows
- John Canny gave a [BIDMach and BIDMat](http://bid2.berkeley.edu/bid-data-project/) demo
- And Saul Perlmutter framed a discussion around goals, dreams, and the needs 
  for workflow tools.

### Working Groups

Tuesday, working group sessions took place simultaneously, in many different 
rooms, and covered most of the scientific topics I've been interested in for 
the last five years, including: 

- Software and Tools,
- Reproducibility and Open Science,
- Education and Training, and
- Alternative metrics and Career Paths.

## Most Influential Work

A fascinating presentation by Mark Stalzer described what the Moore Foundation 
learned about impactful works in data science. Each of the more than 1100 
pre-applications for the Data Driven Discovery Investigators program included 
up to five references that, in the opinion of the author, were some of the most 
influential in data science. The resulting bibliography:

- named IPython the most important tool (well deserved!),
- had an h-index of 16,
- and had enormous representation from Google research papers (in particular, 
  Map Reduce).

## Research Microblogging

Finally, I learned this morning, that David Hogg, who was an excellent feature of this event, 
[blogs](http://hoggresearch.blogspot.com/) five times a week about research! 
Amazing, IMO.  The rules he has instituted for himself are : 

> I must post five days per week (I choose which five), except when traveling, 
> no matter what I have done.

and 

> I must write only about research; no committees, no refereeing, no teaching, 
> no excuses.

It seems overly ambitious and questionably helpful, but I guess he's been doing 
it for years, so it must be serving him well somehow. In the same way that 
Titus' blog is an impressive body of work, so too is this blog. I'm inspired.

He also has [a teaching blog.](http://hoggteaching.blogspot.com/)
